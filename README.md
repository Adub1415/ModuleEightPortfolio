1.How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I approach designing software by working on one aspect at a time before moving on to the next. I feel that by learning how to do one part at a time when you don't complete understand everything expands your knowledge so that the next step will be easier as a result. I feel that my design approach works well I just need to be better at starting my assignments earlier so that if I run into any problems I can figure them out before the deadlines. 

2.How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

A development strategy that I used is keep all the shape information together by seperating it by the load and draw shape. That way if there was a problem with one shapes position or scale I could easily find it within the code. Working on each modules assignment has given me a lot of knowledge about creating 3d scenes that I didn't have before and I thought that this class was very fun and interesting even though I did have struggles along the way. 

3.How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computer science is the future to everything. It is being used more and more and being taught to people at a young age because it gives you access to features that could make your life easier as a result. For one of my classes before we had to make an inventory mobile app that took the manual labor and mistakes out of counting your inventory and was beneficial to use and learn. I'm not sure what professional pathway I will be choosing but I enjoyed learning about 3d scenes more than any other class so far.
