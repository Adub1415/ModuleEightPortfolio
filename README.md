1.Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requrements and goals of the inventory app is to make it easier for users to keep up with their inventory by allowing add items, delete items, sms notifications, and having a table to see the information easier. The user need that it was designed to address is a more effcient way to do inventory.
2.What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens for the application were a login screen, inventory screen, and a notification screen. My method for the screens was it to be simple for users to use and follow while also having all the information needed.
3.How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
The way that I approached coding for the project is going screen by screen and making sure that I included all necessary code for everything to run corrrectly. 
4.How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested my code by running it over and over within android studio. The process is important because coding can have a lot of pieces that all need to work together to complete the final product. 
5.Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to innovate to overcome a challenge when starting to code because I had no idea where to start by doing the interface first but once I figured out where to start it wasn't a problem. 
6.In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think the best part of my app for the interface and code was the login screen. It is simple but effective and is easy for the user to follow.
